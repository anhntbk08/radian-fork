# This factory deals with a common problem in [AngularJS](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=passing+%24scope+variables)
# relating to passing data up and down the `$scope` chain. The solution is simple yet elegant: use a `$rootScope` event
# and callback. This means that any part of the application can set the title by calling
# `pageTitleFactory.setTitle 'foo'` and listen to a title change by passing a callback into
# `pageTitleFactory.addListener cb`.
